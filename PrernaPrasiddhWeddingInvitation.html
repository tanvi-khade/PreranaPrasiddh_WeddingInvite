				<p>
					We met in college and became best friends first, because apparently we
					like to do things the long way. For three years, we laughed, studied
					and built a friendship that neither of us realized was quietly turning
					into something more. Somewhere between endless conversations and movie
					nights, we recognized our favorite place was simply together.
				</p>
				<p>
					That friendship became the foundation for the best years of our lives.
					It carried us through cross-country moves, countless movie nights and
					our unofficial role as restaurant critics; each day was anything but
					ordinary. We learned that the joy was never just in what we were
					doing, but in doing it together. This was the life we wanted to keep
					choosing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it feels like the story we began years ago is ready to keep
					unfolding. Rooted in respect, trust and love, it’s a story that feels
					both familiar and new. We’re excited to continue it together, one page
					at a time.

						<h2>Baraat</h2>

				<div class="section-heading-container">
					<span><h2>Muhuratam</h2></span>
				</div>
				<p>
					Muhūrat - literally meaning “auspicious moment”, is the most sacred
					and significant time window on the wedding day. It is during this
					divinely chosen period that key rituals such as Jeerige Bella, Kanyā
					Dānam, Kankana Bandhana and Maṅgalya Dhāraṇa are performed. Jeerige
					Bella symbolizes the couple’s commitment to live in harmony, united in
					mind and spirit. Kanyā Dānam marks the deeply emotional moment when
					the bride’s father places his daughter’s hand into the groom’s, as the
					groom vows to care for her for the rest of their lives. During this
					ritual, elders pour sacred water and milk over the deity’s idol placed
					on a coconut held jointly by the bride and groom. This act represents
					the collective blessings of the family for a long, prosperous and
					harmonious married life. Maṅgalya Dhāraṇa follows immediately after
					and the entire sequence concludes gracefully with the sacred steps of
					Saptapadi, symbolizing the couple’s journey forward as partners in
					life.
