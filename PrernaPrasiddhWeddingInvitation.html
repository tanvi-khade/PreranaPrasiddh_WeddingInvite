				<p>
					We met in college and became best friends first, because apparently we
					like to do things the long way. For three years, we laughed, studied
					and built a friendship that neither of us realized was quietly turning
					into something more. Somewhere between endless conversations and movie
					nights, we recognized our favorite place was simply together.
				</p>
				<p>
					That friendship became the foundation for the best years of our lives.
					It carried us through cross-country moves, countless movie nights and
					our unofficial role as restaurant critics; each day was anything but
					ordinary. We learned that the joy was never just in what we were
					doing, but in doing it together. This was the life we wanted to keep
					choosing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it feels like the story we began years ago is ready to keep
					unfolding. Rooted in respect, trust and love, it’s a story that feels
					both familiar and new. We’re excited to continue it together, one page
					at a time.
