 It allows both families to celebrate together in a fun & relaxed environment, reinforcing familial ties. It’s a vibrant display of Indian culture, with traditional songs & dances.

December 25 Events:

Baraat  [Rochester]
The Baraat is the groom's joyous wedding procession, symbolizing his journey to claim his bride, marked by music, dancing and vibrant celebration as friends and family escort the groom, often on a decorated horse or vehicle, to the wedding venue for a grand welcome by the bride's side. It signifies the groom's readiness and the collective happiness and pride of both families in uniting.

Muhuratam [Rochester]
Muhūrat - literally meaning “auspicious moment”, is the most sacred and significant time window on the wedding day. It is during this divinely chosen period that key rituals such as Jeerige Bella, Kanyā Dānam, Kankana Bandhana and Maṅgalya Dhāraṇa are performed. Jeerige Bella symbolizes the couple’s commitment to live in harmony, united in mind and spirit. Kanyā Dānam marks the deeply emotional moment when the bride’s father places his daughter’s hand into the groom’s, as the groom vows to care for her for the rest of their lives. During this ritual, elders pour sacred water and milk over the deity’s idol placed on a coconut held jointly by the bride and groom. This act represents the collective blessings of the family for a long, prosperous and harmonious married life. Maṅgalya Dhāraṇa follows immediately after and the entire sequence concludes gracefully with the sacred steps of Saptapadi, symbolizing the couple’s journey forward as partners in life.
